## Chapter 1 - Introduction to Code Review
   * Lesson 1.1 - Why are code reviews important?
     * A learning objective: Understand the importance and significance of code reviews
   * Lesson 1.2 - Different types of programs : Web apps, object oriented, web scraping, data analysis etc.
     * A learning objective: A quick peek into the different types of codes written in Python. The most important categories include Web applications using Django/Flask, Object oriented Programming, Website scraping using BeautifulSoup/Selenium, Machine learning using Pandas and Scikit to name a few
   * Lesson 1.3 - Different styling conventions
     * A learning objective: Introduction to styling guides like PEP8.
## Chapter 2 - Hands-on code reviews
   * Lesson 2.1 - Functions and basic Python
     * A learning objective: This lesson is an actual code review of a basic Python code which includes if/else, for loops and functions
   * Lesson 2.2 - Classes and objects
     * A learning objective: This lesson will include a code review of a code with a more complex concepts like classes.
   * Lesson 2.3 - Data Analysis and modelling
     * A learning objective: A code review of a code which has data cleaning/mining and machine learning components.
   * Lesson 2.4 - Competitive Programming/Data structures and algorithms
     * A learning objective: A code review of codes written for Binary search/Stacks and other optimal algorithms which require test cases and have strict time complexity regulations.
## Chapter 3 - Writing Tests
   * Lesson 3.1 - IDE add-ons : For sublime text, PyCharm etc.
     * A learning objective: Introduce the student to packages and built-in add-ons for the most popular IDE's which automatically take care of the styling. Would include a hands on example as a demonstration
   * Lesson 3.2 - Existing Python packages : Pylint, vulture etc.
     * A learning objective: Introduce the student to python packages like pylint and vulture which format the code automatically. Includes a hands-on example on how these packages work
   * Lesson 3.3 - Writing tests 
     * A learning objective: We will write tests for python codes involving functions and classes to name a few. These tests will subject the code to multiple Input-output tests to ensure correct functionality.
   * Lesson 3.4 - Unit tests for web based applications
     * A learning objective: Unit tests will be written using Selenium to check the integrity of all the different webpages. Includes writing a couple of unit tests
## Chapter 4 - Being a great reviewer
   * Lesson 4.1 - Pre-commit reviews
     * A learning objective: What to look for in your code before committing it. Includes identifying and marking the code as an example of a review.
   * Lesson 4.2 - Work in Progress reviews
     * A learning objective: Features and factors to look at your code when you are still working on the code.Includes identifying and marking the code as an example of a review.
   * Lesson 4.3 - Putting it All Together
     * A learning objective: Final test involving the student to review and modify the code to maintain all the values discussed.
